    This specification foresees different types of account information services:
    * Transaction lists for a given account with transactions with booking status booked or pending including balances if applicable,
    * List of standing orders of a given account, reported as transactions with booking status information,
    * Balances of a given account,
    * A list of addressable accounts,
    * Account details of a given account or of the list of all accessible accounts relative to a granted consent, and
    * Account details might include the account owner name, where specific requirements on the consent process might apply, see below.
    Hereby the definition of the list of addressable and accessible accounts is as follows:
    Definition: The list of addressable accounts of an ASPSP related to a PSU is the list of accounts of a PSU which are open for access through the XS2A API according to the definition 
    of payment accounts provided by [PSD2].
    Definition: The list of accessible accounts of an ASPSP related to a PSU's consent is the list of accounts, where the consent of the PSU has been granted to at least one of the 
    defined account information types. 
    Note: The Read Data Request for the list of addressable accounts and for account details of a given account is syntactically identical. 
    The difference is only in the underlying consent resource, referred to through the HTTP header parameter \"Consent-ID\".
    Example: An ASPSP is providing IBAN1 and IBAN2 to a PSU. The PSU has granted the TPP the consent to access transactions and balances of IBAN1 only. In this case, the addressable accounts are IBAN1 and IBAN2, the list of accessible accounts consists only of IBAN1.
